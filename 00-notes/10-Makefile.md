# Makefile

- in go when we intitiate a module using `go mod init mod_name`, then we can also make a `Makefile`,
- this make file runs the 3 commands of fmt, vet and then build in the order.
- can be modiied, steps can be added or modified also.
- analogous to npm start (the custom scripts in node projects).
